You awake in a clearing in a forest. There are three paths ahead of you, "left", "right" and "ahead".
The "left" path looks winding and appears to lead deeper into the forest.
The "right" path is straight and you can see a long way down it. There looks to be a light at the end.
The path "ahead" slopes downwards. It seems to lead into a cavern.

Which path would you like to take?
