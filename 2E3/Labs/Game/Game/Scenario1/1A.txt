You take the "left" path!
You follow the path for a long time, it twists and winds along. The darkness gets closer and the ground underfoot begins to get softer.
Soon, you hear running water.
Later, you enter a clearing with a stream flowing through it. You begin to ford the stream when you hear a shout behind you...
