As your foe falls, there is an illumination at one of the walls of the cavern.
You trudge towards it.
As you get closer there appears to be an object at the wall that is being illuminated.
It is a throne.
You clamber upon the throne.
The throne is cold and not particularly welcoming, but you feel powerful.
You feel as if you could stay here for eternity.
You sit there, not knowing where you came from or who you are, but you feel as if you've accomplished something...
