You awake in a clearing in a forest. There are three paths ahead of you, "left", "right" and "ahead".
The "left" path looks winding and appears to lead deeper into the forest.
The "right" path is straight and you can see a long way down it. There looks to be a light at the end.
The path "ahead" slopes downwards. It seems to lead into a cavern.

Which path would you like to take?
aheadYou begin to slowly make your way "ahead" down into the cave.
The mouth of the cave is dark and immense.
You hear the far off sound of water dripping.
Cautiously, you make your way into the cave...
After a few seconds, you hear a snap and a voice calls out.
You turn and find yourself face-to-face with the Troll
What do you do? attackYou rush in to battle the Troll!

You continue further downwards into the cave.
The darkness is complete and you rely only on touch and sound.
The sound of running water you heard earlier slowly begins to build to a crescendo.
You arrive to, what you believe is, the side of a raging river.
You begin to try and skirt the bank, but slip and fall into the river.
You struggle but are powerless to fight the raging torrent.
The river sweeps you along...
