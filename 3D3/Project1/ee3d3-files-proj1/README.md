# EE3D3 Project 1

Template for for EE3D3 Project 1 January 2018 

## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `web-server` and `web-client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Provided Files

`web-server.cpp` and `web-client.cpp` are the entry points for the web-server and web-client part of the project.
